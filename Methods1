Logging with Serilog Across Multiple Applications
1. Purpose

In modern .NET solutions, we often have multiple applications such as APIs, worker services, console utilities, and background jobs.
To avoid duplicating logging setup in each project, we establish a centralized and reusable logging approach using:

Microsoft Logger Abstraction â†’ the standard logging interface.

Serilog â†’ the structured logging provider.

Serilog.AspNetCore â†’ seamless integration with the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

This ensures all applications share a consistent, maintainable, and configurable logging experience.

Reusing gRPC Client Factory Across Multiple Applications:--

When multiple applications need to call the same gRPC services, it is inefficient to configure each gRPC client separately. The gRPC Client Factory provides a reusable way to:

Register gRPC clients centrally.

Manage lifetime, pooling, and resilience automatically.

Reuse configuration across APIs, workers, and console apps.

======================================================================================================================================
gRPC Client Factory

Part of the .NET hosting and dependency injection system.

Allows applications to request MyService.MyServiceClient (generated client) via dependency injection.

Internally handles connection reuse and HTTP/2 settings.

Centralized Registration

Instead of repeating configuration in each app, create a shared project or NuGet package (e.g., Company.GrpcClients).

This project registers all required gRPC clients.

Each consuming application only calls the shared setup method.

Configuration Driven

gRPC service endpoints are defined in configuration (appsettings.json).

Each application can point to different environments (Development, Test, Production) without changing code.

Resilience

Built-in integration with Polly policies for retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts.

Ensures consistent error handling across applications.

Multi-Application Reuse

Web APIs can inject gRPC clients to call downstream services.

Worker services can inject the same clients for background processing.

Console apps or utilities can also reuse the same setup.

ðŸ“˜ Authentication Reuse Across Multiple Applications
1. Purpose

In a distributed system with multiple APIs, worker services, and client applications, it is inefficient and inconsistent to implement authentication separately in each application.

By centralizing JWT token authentication and network authentication policies, we can:

Ensure consistent security across all applications.

Reduce duplication of configuration.

Simplify maintenance and future improvements.

2. Key Concepts
ðŸ”¹ JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

What it is: JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism where the server issues a signed token after successful login.

How it works:

User authenticates (e.g., with username/password, OAuth2, or identity provider).

Server issues a JWT containing user claims (roles, permissions, identity).

The JWT is sent by the client on every request via the Authorization header.

Applications validate the token signature, expiration, and claims.

Why reuse: Every application can use the same JWT validation logic, ensuring unified authentication and authorization.

ðŸ”¹ Network Authentication (Shared Policies)

What it is: A standardized way of handling cross-application authentication over HTTP/gRPC within the internal network.

How it works:

Applications enforce incoming requests to require valid JWTs.

Outgoing requests between services automatically include a valid token (retrieved from a secure token provider or identity server).

Token validation uses shared keys, certificates, or identity provider endpoints.

Why reuse: Instead of hardcoding token validation or service-to-service credentials in each application, we centralize this in a shared authentication library.

3. Typical Workflow

Centralized Authentication Library

A shared library defines JWT validation rules (issuer, audience, signing key).

It contains common middleware/configuration for token validation.

Token Issuance

A single Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., IdentityServer, Auth0, Azure AD, Keycloak) issues JWTs.

All applications trust tokens from the same issuer.

Application Reuse

Each application references the shared authentication library.

The library hooks into the application pipeline (ASP.NET Core middleware or gRPC interceptors).

Network Calls

For service-to-service calls, the shared library automatically attaches tokens to outgoing requests.

Downstream services validate these tokens using the same centralized configuration.

4. Benefits

Consistency â†’ All applications use the same token validation rules.

Security â†’ Centralized management of signing keys, issuers, and policies.

Reusability â†’ One library used across APIs, worker services, and gRPC clients.

Flexibility â†’ Different applications can override settings (e.g., audiences or scopes).

Maintainability â†’ Security updates apply everywhere without modifying each app.

5. Extensibility

Role & Claim Enforcement â†’ Standardize role/permission checks across apps.

Multi-Tenant Support â†’ Handle different audiences for different clients.

Service-to-Service Authentication â†’ Use client credentials flow to get tokens for background jobs.

Observability â†’ Add logging and metrics for failed/successful authentications.
