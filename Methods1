Logging with Serilog Across Multiple Applications
1. Purpose

In modern .NET solutions, we often have multiple applications such as APIs, worker services, console utilities, and background jobs.
To avoid duplicating logging setup in each project, we establish a centralized and reusable logging approach using:

Microsoft Logger Abstraction → the standard logging interface.

Serilog → the structured logging provider.

Serilog.AspNetCore → seamless integration with the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

This ensures all applications share a consistent, maintainable, and configurable logging experience.

Reusing gRPC Client Factory Across Multiple Applications:--

When multiple applications need to call the same gRPC services, it is inefficient to configure each gRPC client separately. The gRPC Client Factory provides a reusable way to:

Register gRPC clients centrally.

Manage lifetime, pooling, and resilience automatically.

Reuse configuration across APIs, workers, and console apps.
