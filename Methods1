Logging with Serilog Across Multiple Applications
1. Purpose

In modern .NET solutions, we often have multiple applications such as APIs, worker services, console utilities, and background jobs.
To avoid duplicating logging setup in each project, we establish a centralized and reusable logging approach using:

Microsoft Logger Abstraction → the standard logging interface.

Serilog → the structured logging provider.

Serilog.AspNetCore → seamless integration with the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

This ensures all applications share a consistent, maintainable, and configurable logging experience.

Reusing gRPC Client Factory Across Multiple Applications:--

When multiple applications need to call the same gRPC services, it is inefficient to configure each gRPC client separately. The gRPC Client Factory provides a reusable way to:

Register gRPC clients centrally.

Manage lifetime, pooling, and resilience automatically.

Reuse configuration across APIs, workers, and console apps.

gRPC Client Factory

Part of the .NET hosting and dependency injection system.

Allows applications to request MyService.MyServiceClient (generated client) via dependency injection.

Internally handles connection reuse and HTTP/2 settings.

Centralized Registration

Instead of repeating configuration in each app, create a shared project or NuGet package (e.g., Company.GrpcClients).

This project registers all required gRPC clients.

Each consuming application only calls the shared setup method.

Configuration Driven

gRPC service endpoints are defined in configuration (appsettings.json).

Each application can point to different environments (Development, Test, Production) without changing code.

Resilience

Built-in integration with Polly policies for retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts.

Ensures consistent error handling across applications.

Multi-Application Reuse

Web APIs can inject gRPC clients to call downstream services.

Worker services can inject the same clients for background processing.

Console apps or utilities can also reuse the same setup.
